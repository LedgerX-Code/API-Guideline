# What Is An API
An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together.

# API Guideline 
This guideline can be implemented in various programming language. In this document, there are four example of implementation of CryptoEstate API :

- [C# Programming Language](https://github.com/SysCodeMY/CryptoEstateAPI/wiki/CryptoEstate-API-Implementation-on-C%23-Language)
- [PHP Programming Language](https://github.com/SysCodeMY/CryptoEstateAPI/wiki/CryptoEstate-API-Implementation-using-CURL-PHP-and-AJAX-to-retrieve-JSON-data-with-Datatable-JQuery-JS.)
- [Java Programming Language](https://github.com/SysCodeMY/CryptoEstateAPI/wiki/CryptoEstate-API-Implementation-on-Java-Language)
- [Python Programming Language](https://github.com/SysCodeMY/CryptoEstateAPI/wiki/CryptoEstate-API-Implementation-on-Python-Language)
